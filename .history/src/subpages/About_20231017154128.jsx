        We think of wedding photography not as a single practice, but as several interlocking ones.
        Moments are inseparable from emotions, lighting is inseparable from capturing the essence of
        the event, and enhancing the couple's bond is the ultimate goal of our work. Trends in
        photography may come and go, but we have found these principles to be timeless. As a wedding
        photographer, Sofia Lindstr√∂m and I strive for honesty and clarity. Our primary focus is to
        comprehend the couple's vision and desires, not to impose our own style. We value
        timeliness, open communication, and providing glimpses of the captured moments over
        elaborate presentations. Moreover, we appreciate the personal touch of face-to-face
        meetings, perhaps over a cup of coffee or a meal. Over the years, we have been fortunate to
        collaborate with amazing couples on their special day, but we believe it is still too early
        to judge the success of our work. Wedding photographs exist in time and their value is
        directly related to how well they continue to evoke cherished memories. We are proud of our
        artistic style and background, but do not consider ourselves proponents of a particular
        photography school. Photography has no fixed style, as each wedding is unique and demands a
        tailored approach that complements the couple's story and preferences.
